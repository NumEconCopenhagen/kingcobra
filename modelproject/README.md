# Modelproject - Solving the Basic Solow model and variations of it 

This projects has its roots in "Introducing Advanced Macroeconomics - Growth and Business Cycles" written by Peter Birch Sørensen and Hans Jørgen Whitta-Jacobsen. The project builds on chapter 3 (The Basic Solow Model), chapter 5 (The general Solow Model), chapter 6 (The Solow Model with Human Capital) and finally chapter 7 (The Solow Model with Land). The goal of the project is to determine how adding technology, human capital and land changes The Basic Solow Model and to see how they compare to one another. This will be accomplished by solving the models in terms of steady state values for capital, output and capital-output ratios, both visually and numerically. 

Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation the project requires no further installations.
The results of the project can be seen from running the file modelproject.ipynb placed in the map dataproject.
