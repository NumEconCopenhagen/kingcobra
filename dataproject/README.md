# Dataproject

This project contains data from the World Bank of growth in GDP and expenditure on eduction. Our objective was to see if there is a correlation between these variables. 

To produce the results we cleaned the datasets by removing empty cells as well as countries with low amount of data. Following this process the datasets were merged and a scatter plot of growth in GDP and expenditure on ediction was created.
