# Dataproject

This project contains data from the World Bank of growth in GDP and expenditure on eduction. Our objective was to see if there is a correlation between these variables. 

To produce the results we cleaned the datasets by removing empty cells as well as countries with low amount of data. Four figures have been created to illustrate how GDP and expenditure on eduction change over time - both for all the countries and for each seperate country. Following this process the datasets were merged. The scatter plot and the heatmap should illustrate the correlation between the two variables.
