# Dataproject

This project contains data from the World Bank of growth in GDP and expenditure on eduction for a range of different countries. The objective is to see if there is a trend between these variables. 

To obtain this, the datasats were cleaned by removing empty cells as well as countries with insuffienct amounts of data. Several figures were created to try and illustrate firstly how education develops and secondly how GDP develops. For both expenditure on eduction and GDP growth there has been created graphs focusing on specific countries and graphs that give an overview of the general trend for all the countries combined. 

Following this process the datasets were merged. The scatter plot and the heatmap tries to illustrate if there is a trend between the two sets of data. Furthermore figures of the average annual change in expenditure on education and GDP growth were created as well as a figure with a regression.
