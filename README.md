# Welcome to your NumEconCPH repository

We have provided you with the following repository that contains the required structure for this course. **You should not change any folders in the root directory**.

A short description of the files and folders:

* [README.md](/README.md): gives a short introduction to your project. You should change this file so it gives an introduction to what your repository consists of, and how to run the code to get your output. The present README file is always present on [github](https://www.github.com/numeconcopenhagen/numeconcopenhagen-2018/blob/master/README.md).
* [/binder](/binder/): The folder is used by mybinder.org to setup an interactive version of your repository. For details see this [guide](https://numeconcopenhagen.netlify.com/guides/mybinder/).
* [/dataproject](/dataproject): The structure is as follows: it contains a jupyter notebook where all the results should be presented. Furthermore, there is a python module named the dataproject where you can write and structure all your code.
* [/examproject](/examproject): Same structure as above.
* [/modelproject](/modelproject): Same structure as above.
* [.gitignore](/.gitignore): A textfile specifying files and folder that will not be uploaded to github, and will not be tracked by git.  



# Introduction to the repository
This repository has its roots in the course "Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis". It consists of three different projects which all contains a jupyter notebook where the results of each project will be presented:

* A data project containing an analysis of growth in GDP and growth in EDU. 
* A model project containing an analysis of the basic Solow model, the general Solow model, the Solow model with human and the Solow model with land.
* An exam project solving the "human capital accumulation"-problem, the AS-AD model and "exchange economy"-problem.

Furthermore, the repository also contains: 
* A feedback.txt file with a list of the groups each group member has given his peer feedback to. 
* A binder folder used by mybinder.org to setup an interactive version of the repository.
* A gitignore file specifying files and folder that will not be uploaded to github which will not be tracked by git. 

In order to run the projects you will need a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation. Furthermore, you will need to install the different packages introduced in the first lines of each project.
