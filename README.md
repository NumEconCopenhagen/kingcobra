# Introduction to the repository
This repository has its roots in the course "Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis". It consists of three different projects:

* A data project containing an analysis of growth in GDP and growth in EDU. 
* A model project containing an analysis of the basic Solow model, the general Solow model, the Solow model with human and the Solow model with land.
* An exam project solving the "human capital accumulation"-problem, the AS-AD model and "exchange economy"-problem.

Each project contains a jupyter notebook where the results will be presented.

Furthermore, the repository also contains: 
* A feedback.txt file with a list of the groups each group member has given his peer feedback to. 
* A binder folder used by mybinder.org to setup an interactive version of the repository.
* A gitignore file specifying files and folder that will not be uploaded to github which will not be tracked by git. 

As a part of the exam we have improved the data project and model project. The improvements in the data project includes fecthing data from an API, correcting some minor errors and removing redundant code. The improvements in the model project includes adding an numerical solution to the solow models from chapter 3, 5 and 6 as well as correcting minor errors.
