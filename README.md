# Introduction to the repository
This is the repository for the group kingcobra. It has its roots in the course "Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis" and consists of the following folders:

* [/dataproject](/dataproject): The folder containing our data project. This project includes an analysis of growth in GDP and growth in EDU for a wide variety of countries. 
* [/modelproject](/modelproject): The folder containing our model project. This project includes an analysis of the basic Solow model, the general Solow model, the Solow model with human and the Solow model with land.
* [/examproject](/examproject): The folder containing our exam project. This includes solving the "human capital accumulation"-problem, the AS-AD model and "exchange economy"-problem.

The folders above each contains a jupyter notebook where the results will be presented.

Furthermore, the repository also contains: 
* [Feedback.txt](/Feedback.txt): A feedback.txt file with a list of the groups each group member has given his peer feedback to. 
* [/binder](/binder/): The folder used by mybinder.org to setup an interactive version of the repository.
* [.gitignore](/.gitignore): A gitignore file specifying files and folder that will not be uploaded to github which will not be tracked by git. 

As a part of the exam we have improved the data project and model project. The improvements in the data project includes fecthing data from an API, correcting some minor errors and removing redundant code. The improvements in the model project includes adding an numerical solution to the solow models from chapter 3, 5 and 6 as well as correcting some minor errors.
