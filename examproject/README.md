# Examproject - Solving the "human capital accumulation"-problem, the AS-AD model and the "exchange economy"-problem

This project is a part of the exam in the course "Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis". It consists of three different problem sets:

* The "human capital accumulation"-problem: This problem set solves the utility problem for a consumer in a given economy and how she decides whether to work or not.
* The AS-AD model: This problem set solves the supply and demand problem and analyses what happens when different parameters of the model changes. 
* The "Exchange economy"-problem: This problem set solves an exchange economy with three goods and an infinite amount of consumers. This includes finding the budget shares, the Walras equilibrium and a simulation.

In order to run the project you will need a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation. Furthermore, you will need to install the different packages introduced in the first line of the project. The results of the project can be seen from running the file exam_project.ipynb.
